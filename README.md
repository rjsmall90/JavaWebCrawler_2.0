# JavaWebCrawler 2.0
I have an app idea that involves a the usage of a web crawler and wanted to build one in Java to see how it functions. 

Using Java, Maven, & Apache HttpClient for the connection - Building an upgraded web crawler that given a keyword can locate and collect links, and excerpts
where instances of the keyword appear, and print out to a text file. 

## What I Did Differently
Using Apache HttpClient allows me to build out the connection process manually and make my own GET & POST requests as needed. This way I can see exactly what info I'm requesting and manipulate it more freely than with JSoup. 

## How To Use
