# JavaWebCrawler 2.0
I have an app idea that involves a the usage of a web crawler and wanted to build one in Java to see how it functions. 

Using Java, Maven, & JSoup - Building a Web Crawler that given a keyword can locate and collect links, and excerpts
where instances of the keyword appear, as well as printing to text file. 

## What I Did Differently

## How To Use
• Functions by calling Spider.search(url, searchWord). Returns true if word found. 

• Then compiles a list of links that are accessible by calling SpiderLeg.getLinks();
